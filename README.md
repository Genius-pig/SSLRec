Our library includes various self-supervised learning recommendation algorithms, covering five major categories:

+ General Collaborative Filtering
+ Sequential Recommendation
+ Multi-Behavior Recommendation
+ Social Recommendation
+ Knowledge Graph-enhanced Recommendation

We offer a unified training, validation, and testing process for each category, along with a standardized data preprocessing method using publicly available datasets. 
This enables the quick reproduction of various models and the fair comparison of different methods.

## Get Started

SSLRec is implemented under the following development environment:

+ python==3.10.4
+ numpy==1.22.3
+ torch==1.11.0
+ scipy==1.7.3

You can easily train LightGCN using our framework by running the following script:
```
python main.py --model LightGCN
```
This script will run the LightGCN model on the yelp datasets. 

The training configuration for LightGCN is saved in [lightgcn.yml](https://github.com/HKUDS/SSLRec/blob/main/config/modelconf/lightgcn.yml), 
and you can modify the values to achieve different training effects. Additionally, you can replace LightGCN with other implemented models listed under [Models](./docs/Models.md).

For users who want to learn more, we recommend reading the [User Guide](https://github.com/HKUDS/SSLRec/blob/main/docs/User%20Guide.md), which provides detailed explanations of SSLRec concepts and usage, including:
+ SSLRec framework architecture design
+ Implementing your own model in SSLRec
+ Deploying your own datasets in SSLRec
+ Implementing your own training process in SSLRec
+ Automatic hyper-parameter tuning in SSLRec

and so on.
